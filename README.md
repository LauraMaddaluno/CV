## Laura Maddaluno

I am a junior software developer, resilient, reflective and passionate about coding. During last year, I taught myself how to code, using resources like Udemy, freeCodeCamp, codebar and Codecademy. I successfully built my first projects in HTML, CSS, JS within a short time.

I enjoy undertaking new challenges both in coding and my life’s journey. I attain complete satisfaction upon achieving beneficial results and solutions, which in turn encourages me to continuously improve.
As a career changer and a codenewbie, I am thrilled by the idea of improving people's lives through technology.

## Skills
I am **resilient** and **determined** to find solutions to the challenges I face, both in life and coding. I use what I have and what I know to produce the best possible results in a given situation.This makes me feel fulfilled and pushes me to continually improve myself. 
I was able to balance my duties as a full - time mom of a 3 years old with my learning schedule, as a result of which I built my first projects and won a Makers' scholarship.
 
**Communication**, **self-motivation**, **performing under pressure**, and **teamwork** are all transferable qualities that I've honed through my singing career. I had the opportunity to plan concerts and events where the performance was enjoyed by the audience and was fulfilling for the musicians. My aim is the same for coding, I adore the idea that people can interact with what I have created and, even better, they can use it. 

My mindset is based on rules and **logical thinking**, thanks to my studies in mathematics, Latin and ancient Greek. These skills, combined with my **calm**, **confident and reassuring personality**, have meant that I have helped my students with different learning styles to achieve excellent results. My perseverance and attention to detail helped my pupils to improve on their learning styles and the majority of them achieved an A score especially in mathematics.
